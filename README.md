# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation, a crucial task in marketing and customer relationship management. Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into groups with similar characteristics, behaviors, or needs, which enables businesses to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively.

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to utilize K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographic information, or any other relevant features available in the dataset.

# Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis, handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.
K-Means Clustering: Implementation of K-Means algorithm using scikit-learn.
Elbow Method: Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Visualization: Visualizing the clusters and interpreting the results.
Customer Profiling: Analyzing and interpreting the characteristics of each customer segment.
Dataset:
The project uses a sample dataset containing customer information such as age, gender, income, and purchasing behavior. The dataset can be replaced with other relevant datasets depending on the specific business context.
